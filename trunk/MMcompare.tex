\chapter{Model-Experiment Comparison}\label{c:compare}

In this chapter we'll discuss some general methods for comparing model predictions with experimental observations.  We are interested in being able to answer the questions, \emph{How good is the model?}, or more specifically, \emph{How good is the model at predicted the behavior of the physical system?}  We'll also present examples that show how these general concepts can be applied to particular models and experiments such as static and first-order models of physical systems like bending beams and temperature sensors.

We can make both \glspl{qualitative comparison} and \glspl{quantitative comparison} between model predictions and experimental data.  A qualitative comparison is based on subjective criteria such as does the time-response of our model ``look like'' the observed experimental data.  Qualitative evaluation is important, but it can only get us so far.
