\chapter{Preface}

These course notes are intended to support and complement the online course \emph{Control of Mobile Robots} developed by Dr. Magnus Egerstedt at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  These notes are being developed in the fall semester of 2013 to support a course at the University of Hawaii at Manoa inspired by Dr. Egnerstedt's offering.  

The concept of tranlating my course-specific notes into a more general textbook is the result of working with Professor Allen Downey at Olin College.  Professor Downey is a prophet of free books and has authored many which he distributes at Green Tea Press (\url{http://greenteapress.com/}).
